    pNums[1] = "The dawn rays of the sun greet you as you begin your preparations for the time of trial. Today you will become the youngest ever to challenge for the title of Grandmaster of the Five Winds. When your foster father, Naijishi, was murdered by Yaemon, the second Grandmaster stepped into his place. Now, many seasons later another of the Grandmasters has died and the position is open once more for there must always be five who lead the order. You have been invited to challenge for it because of your consummate mastery of the Way of the Tiger.\n" +
            "At the appointed hour you walk, alone, across the sands to the Temple of the Rock. It is a huge pillared hall built into the side of an enormous boulder of red granite brought to rest on the Island of Tranquil Dreams by the ice floes of the age of snow, which carved out the Great Valley Reaches of the far north. As you approach the Temple, you see that the monks and a large number of villagers have assembled to watch the combat between you and the other challenger, Gorobei.\n" +
            "Like you, Gorobei is an Initiate of the Inner Circle, a devout worshipper of Kwon and a capable fighter. He is older, heavier and stronger than you and has been unsuccessful in one previous challenge, but he is a skillful wrestler. You walk into the Temple and bow to the Grandmaster of the Dawn, a man who looks younger than his fifty years, slim and taut with piercing dark eyes. Beside you, Gorobei also bows, his face a mask showing no emotion. He is clad only in a loin cloth and his rippling muscles gleam with an oil that will make it difficult to keep a grip on him. You must defeat him in unarmed combat in order to be allowed to undertake the spiritual test which will show whether you are > ready to become a Grandmaster. Gorobei turns to you and bows and you return the courtesy. The Grandmaster of the Dawn reminds you that this is not a fight to the death and you may not use Inner Force. He signals for you to begin. Gorobei advances warily across the polished granite floor, his big hands ready to grapple you. Will you: Feint a punch and then use the Leaping Tiger kick (turn to 17)?\t\n" +
            "Pretend to grapple but instead use the Cobra Strike jab (turn to 35)?\n" +

            "Halfway up your keen sight notices a network of 1: fine threads stretched across the staircase and connected to wires which disappear through holes in the inner wall. You stand on your hands and 'walk' up the staircase, feeling for the near invisible threads as you go and straining your ears for the slightest sound. At last you are past them. Turn to 399.\n"
    pNums[3] = "The hook catches the castle wall and you leap to- wards the far side of the moat. You hit the water with a splash and begin pulling yourself up to the wall as fast as you can. The water boils around you as the Floating Mouths streak towards their prey and two are still fixed to you as you pull yourself out. Lose 3 Endurance as they tear at your flesh. If you are still alive, you sweep them away and, standing up, look around. The Dark Elf is nowhere to be seen, lost in the swamp, and the knight lies spreadeagled on the sand but the man in blue and gold robes is floating across the moat on a small ice floe. Turn to 372."
    pNums[4] = "The priests rush to the edge of the river and one of them catches sight of you and points. They begin to throw off their chainmail. Are you skillful with Poison Needle Darts? If you are and would like to use one, turn to 419. If you are not or would, in any case, rather swim powerfully away upstream, turn to 121."
    pNums[5] = "You lie in the murk of the swamp and the Troll stench washes over you as it bends down and picks you up in its claws. Lose 2 Endurance for its rough handling as it prepares to eat you. If you are still alive, as you near its gaping maw, you smash your iron sleeves into its face. You see the black blood spurting from its eye begin to dwindle to a trickle as the squashed eye remolds itself. But it drops you in surprise and you flee as fast as you can Turn to 14."
    pNums[6] = "You pass through the archway of purple-black glass and on into the city of Doomover itself. You cannot remember ever having seen so many buildings, solid and tall, their roofs of sloping slates, not thatch, and there are shops everywhere, selling fish, wine, grain and there is even a slave market. Near the Obsidian Gate a town-crier begins to ring his bell. He is dressed in orange and green to attract attention, and he begins to shout loudly about a brave adventurer who lived in Doomover who has reaped rich rewards and found a secret way into the death-city of Mortavalon, having entered a cave in the hills which encircle that city. Next he proclaims loudly that the army is paying well for recruits, that there is no war but men are needed for maneuvers on the Plain of Feet. There are rows of barracks not far from the harbor. Do you:\n" +

It is still a tenday before the moon will turn red at the conjunction of the planets arid you can see preparations begin in the outer bailey. Yaemon, Honoric and Manse the Deathmage will set out for the Pillars of Change on the morrow. Your prayers to Kwon for a stormy moonless night are answered and you decide that on this night you will complete your mission or die honorably in the attempt. The wind and the rain and the darkness will make it possible for you to pass into the castle as if invisible. You prepare yourself in silent meditation, and don your Ninja costume before staring up into the darkness until your night vision is as acute as an owl's. If you have the skill of Climbing and wish to scale the castle wall, turn to 392. Otherwise, 26 you may raise the grille outside the moat and drop1 to the tunnel below. In this case, turn to 402."
    pNums[8] = "The Barbarian tenses as you place the needle on your rolled tongue and spit it out in one fluid motion. The needle pierces his cheek. He has an iron constitution and although a look of agony twists his features, his system overcomes the virulent poison. You may note that he has lost 4 Endurance. As you pause in astonishment, he strikes at you and his sword cleaves the air towards your shoulder. Your Defense against his blow is 8 as you try to bring your left forearm up to sweep aside the blade. If he hits you, his sword will do 1 Die + 1 damage. If you survive you may use the Cobra Strike (turn to 377), the Winged Horse (turn to 302) or the Dragon's Tail (turn to 318)."
    pNums[9] = "Although the hooded cobra can strike faster than the eye can see, you are faster still. You grab it’s neck in one hand and slice off its head with a Shuriken held in the other. Manse is on his back but he can still cast spells and his Eldritch words ring in your brain as the force of his magic is again brought to bear. He clenches his fist and it is as if iron bars were pressing on you from all sides. His pallid face quivers with effort as he clenches the fist ever tighter until your ribcage collapses. He opens his hand and you fall lifeless to the floor. You have failed your mission."

    pNums[10] = "He looks at you and nods, apparently satisfied. You sleep the night in the strange monk's cave. He has few possessions and says he has not seen another human being in years, except in sleep. It seems he feeds on air for he has nothing to offer you other than cool and refreshing mountain rain-water. In the morning he claims that he has, somehow, seen Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame, journeying north with Honoric, servant of Vasch-Ro, Marshal of the Legion of the Sword of Doom, from the city of Doomover.\n" +
            "'And they journey to meet a third’ he says, 'Manse the Deathmage, who reverences Nemesis. A most powerful and evil sorcerer. This unholy alliance must be stopped. Of all the evil gods, only the followers of Vile, Vasch-Ro and Nemesis have the discipline to act in alliance. Nemesis is the greatest of the evil gods. Never before have three such powerful and evil men trusted each other.’\n" +
            "'It is the conjunction of the planets’ you reply. Togawa pulls a bag of herbs from a crack in the rock.\n" +
            "‘These have healing virtue’ he says. You take them and may use them at any time when you are not being attacked to restore up to 8 Endurance points, once only. You thank him and are about to ask him if he will accompany you when he lies down on the cave floor and goes to sleep. Sensing that there is no further help to be gained, you begin the climb down Mount Gwalodrun to the pass below. A day later you enter the foothills of Fortune Pass. Turn to 70.\n"
    pNums[11] = "The Shuriken only wounds the first guard and he cries the alarm. You see magical lights appearing around the castle like Will-O'-the-Wisps and decide to climb back down the tower, cross the moat once more and try to enter the castle through the grille that leads to an underground tunnel. Turn to 398."
    pNums[12] = "You swim upstream but as you go, they begin chanting again, and as their spell takes effect you find you cannot move your limbs. You float gently downstream, into their welcoming arms and they bind you securely. If you have a Ring, they take it from you, cross it off your Character Sheet. Are you a skilled Escapologist? If you are, turn to 21. If you are not, turn to 37."

    pNums[16] = "You walk to the barracks and join a queue of people, some young and fit, others older, looking a little, down on their luck. You are chosen with a few of the others to demonstrate your skill with the sword, which you manage adequately but not well, never having been trained in sword play. You are grouped together and given drill practice for some hours, before being marched to your night barracks. You manage to discover that the Legion of the Sword of Doom is going to attack the people of the Spires of Foreshadowing but that there is plenty of time to be trained for battle, because its leader, Honoric, has left the city and journeyed north. As you all settle down to sleep, they begin to talk of pillaging the Spires and the loot that they will bring home. The barracks are guarded in case any of the new recruits think better of joining up but you decide that there is nothing more of interest here and try to desert in the quiet hours before dawn. You wrap your black Ninja headgear around your head until only the slits of your eyes are visible and don your black costume. If you have the skill of Climbing and would like to leave the barracks from the roof, turn to 75. Otherwise, you decide to creep up behind the guard whilst the others sleep. Turn to 86."

You can tell by the white scars on his back that he is one of the two who has been in slave galleys before. His upper body is huge, his chest unnaturally deep and his legs squat and tapering to small feet, giving him the appearance of a toad. He tells you that he had been enslaved as a boy and knows no other life than that of the oar deck. He groans quietly at the savage twist of Fate that has befallen him and tells you that he was the only one on his last slave ship to live longer than a year. The buccaneers appoint an Overseer and two whip hands to patrol the Aquamarines oar deck. It seems they are going to sell her and her crew at some lawless port. Are you an Escapologist?

He tells you that his home city, Tor, lies up river. You ask him whether there is a temple to Kwon there and he shakes his head but freely tells you that his goddess is the Allmother, Preserver of Life.

There are temples to other gods but the Cathedral to the Wargod overshadows them all. The Marshal of the Legion of the Sword of Doom is Honoric, a blackheart who has never been defeated in combat. It is said that he once slew a storm giant, single handed. He is without doubt a peerless swordsman. The order of the Scarlet Mantis has a temple there too. They send their acolytes to the Far Snows for training, where they become used to hardship of all kinds. Yaemon is the greatest warrior they have ever had to lead them.

He curses and you are shocked to hear his voice, resonant and macabre, as he says, 'I cannot see you, Follower, but know that none can stand before the sorcery of Manse tire Deathmage.’ With that he pulls back and behind him, you catch sight of another, a man in scarlet robes, with a belt of black and gold.

Hearing through the grapevine that Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame, was visiting the monastery, he foolishly decided to throw himself before the arch monk and beg for his job again. Yaemon, surprisingly, received him but sneeringly told him that even the gutter was too good a place for him. He had a friend with him, a wicked looking man, with a wicked heart. He had the most hideous, soulless red eyes . . . Manse the Deathmage, they called him. Anyway, just for sport he said he would punish me, and before I know it my arm drops off.

Your Manmarcher father was one but I triumphed over him as I did over all the others.' You are about to ask him if who your father was when he is racked by a fit of coughing which robs him of his last breath. Yaemon is dead and you have succeeded in your mission.

You must return the Scrolls of Kettsuin to their rightful place at the Temple of the Rock on the Island of Tranquil Dreams, but your journey will be beset with dangers. I will aid you; choose a skill from the Way of the Tiger which you have not yet mastered and I will grant you its knowledge. It shall be as if you had practiced it from your birthing.' The god continues, 'I will aid you, but once, at a time of great danger. If you truly have need of me, say only \"Kwon, redeem me\", and I shall be your salvation. I will watch over you, Avenger, for it is my hope that one day you will join me in the Garden of the Gods.'
